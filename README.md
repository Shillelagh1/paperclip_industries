This project is dead. Lost all the files after several months of not progress because I didn't upload the files to this github, which I created specifically to avoid this from happening lmao.

# paperclip_industries
Play an overengineered game, win stupid prizes.

Still in development, not in a playable state.

To start the game, run the .exe file Clipindustry/Clipindustry/bin/Release/net6.0/Clipindustry.exe, or optionally Clipindustry/Clipindustry/bin/Debug/net6.0/Clipindustry.exe if no release is available/

To generate a map.txt file:
https://github.com/Shillelagh1/Pclip_Mapgen

NOTE:
Map generation and loading are EXTREMELY bugged. Need to redo.
