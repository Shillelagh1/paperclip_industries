# paperclip_industries
Play an overengineered game, win stupid prizes.

Still in development, not in a playable state.

To start the game, run the .exe file Clipindustry/Clipindustry/bin/Release/net6.0/Clipindustry.exe, or optionally Clipindustry/Clipindustry/bin/Debug/net6.0/Clipindustry.exe if no release is available/

To generate a map.txt file:

NOTE:
Map generation and loading are EXTREMELY bugged. Need to redo.
